# Thermo_EoS
Programs to compute chemical potential, entropy, free-energy and pressure from a given temperature dependent EoS


Things left to still do:

1) Clean and modularize code, it works but it ain't pretty.
2) Write a script finalizing the OS (one-shot) run into multi-runs

New Things left to still do:

1) Thoroughly test the modulated therm_eos program
2) Write a python script for automatic runing and output scrubbing
